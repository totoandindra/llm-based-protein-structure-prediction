## Research Applications

### 1. Homology-Based Structure Prediction
```python
# Template identification using sequence alignments
from Bio import pairwise2
from Bio.Seq import Seq

query_seq = Seq("MKDLSLSLSLSL...")
template_structures = load_pdb_sequences('data/protein_structures/')

for template in template_structures:
    alignment = pairwise2.align.globalxx(query_seq, template.seq)
    if alignment[0][2] > threshold:
        print(f"Template found: {template.id}")
```

### 2. Machine Learning Model Training
```python
# Feature extraction for ML models
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load processed datasets
features = pd.read_csv('data/processed/synthetic_protein_properties.csv')
X = features[['protein_length', 'hydrophobicity_score', 'charge', 'molecular_weight']]
y = features['fold_type']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```

### 3. Deep Learning Pipeline Integration
```python
# Sequence-to-structure prediction pipeline
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class ProteinDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, sequences_file, structures_dir):
        self.sequences = self.load_sequences(sequences_file)
        self.structures = self.load_structures(structures_dir)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        seq_features = self.encode_sequence(self.sequences[idx])
        struct_target = self.encode_structure(self.structures[idx])
        return seq_features, struct_target

dataset = ProteinDataset('data/sequences/uniprot_sprot.fasta', 
                        'data/protein_structures/')
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```

## Methodological Considerations

### Sequence-Structure Relationships
Our dataset enables investigation of fundamental questions:
- How does amino acid composition influence structural class?
- Which sequence features are most predictive of fold topology?
- How do evolutionary constraints shape structure-function relationships?

### Benchmark Design Principles
Evaluation datasets follow established benchmarking practices:
1. **Non-redundancy**: Sequences with <30% identity to training data
2. **Structural diversity**: Coverage of major fold classes (SCOP/CATH)
3. **Difficulty stratification**: Easy/medium/hard prediction categories
4. **Temporal validation**: Test sets from structures released after training

### Data Representation Strategies
Multiple encoding schemes supported:
- **One-hot encoding**: Standard 20 amino acid alphabet
- **Physicochemical features**: Hydrophobicity, charge, volume, flexibility
- **Evolutionary features**: Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs)
- **Structural features**: Secondary structure, solvent accessibility
