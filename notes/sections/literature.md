# Literature Review: LLM-Based Protein Structure Prediction

## Executive Summary

This literature review examines the revolutionary intersection of large language models (LLMs) and protein structure prediction, an area that has witnessed unprecedented breakthroughs since 2020. The convergence of deep learning architectures, particularly transformer models, with protein bioinformatics has fundamentally transformed our ability to predict protein structures from amino acid sequences, achieving near-experimental accuracy in many cases.

## 1. Introduction and Background

### 1.1 The Protein Folding Problem

The prediction of three-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences has been called "the second half of the genetic code" and represents one of biology's most challenging computational problems. For over 50 years, researchers have struggled to understand how a linear chain of amino acids folds into complex three-dimensional structures that determine biological function.

### 1.2 Historical Context

Traditional approaches to protein structure prediction relied on:
- **Physics-based methods**: Using energy minimization and molecular dynamics
- **Homology modeling**: Leveraging structural similarity to known proteins
- **Threading approaches**: Fitting sequences onto existing structural templates
- **Fragment assembly**: Combining small structural fragments

These methods, while scientifically sound, often fell short of atomic accuracy, particularly for proteins without structural homologs.

## 2. The Deep Learning Revolution

### 2.1 Pre-Transformer Era

Early deep learning applications in protein structure prediction included:
- **Contact prediction**: Using neural networks to predict residue-residue contacts
- **Secondary structure prediction**: Predicting ±-helices and ²-sheets
- **Distance geometry**: Converting predicted distances to 3D coordinates

### 2.2 Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP)

CASP competitions, held biennially since 1994, provide independent benchmarking for structure prediction methods. The CASP14 (2020) and CASP15 (2022) competitions marked inflection points where AI-based methods achieved dramatic improvements over traditional approaches.
